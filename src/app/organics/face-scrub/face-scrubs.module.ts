      leaving it feeling soft and radiant. Gently removes dead cells & black pore.
      Revive lackluster skin with our refreshing, mild scrub. Real Strawberry Seeds and Cornmeal gently
      buff away dry skin and dulling, dead skin cellsâ€”leaving skin softer, smoother, and refreshed.
      The minerals help to promote circulation, reduce the inflammatory response, and act as a
      detoxifying agent and general muscle relaxant.`,
